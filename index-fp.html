        <h2><u>Our Purpose</u></h2>
        <p>We are a new and potentially ground breaking organization that is looking to connect volunteers to local charities in their area.  With your help, these charities could take a step in the right direction.</p>
          
        <h2><u>Sign up</u></h2>
        <p>By clicking the links at the top of the page, you will be taken directly to that specific page.</p>
            
        <p>The "List of Charities" tab will show you the list of charities available to volunteer for through HelpHub as well as give a brief explanation of them.  You will also be able to go to the charities profile by clicking on the name of the charity.</p>
